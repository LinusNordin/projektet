<h2>ABH</h2>
<p>Accelerated Backwards Hopping or ABH for short, is a glitch in all Source 2013 Singleplayer games. It is most infamous for its extensive usage in Half-Life 2. It was discovered within 24 hours of the release of The Orange Box, in Portal.
    For some minor history recap; The Orange Box was a collection of games released in 2007, HL2 itself was released in 2004. When HL2 first released, it had forward bunnyhopping like (for example) the old quake games. After the release of The Orange Box, Valve (the developers of Source and the respective games on it) decided to go back and update HL2. With this they patched out bunnyhopping, or so they thought.
    You see, their solution was to apply negative speed to the player when it was detected that the player was jumping with speed over the speedcap. Easy, right?
    Well, the thing is that since HL2 is a 3D game, the players speed is a three dimensional vector. So if you are looking forwards and jumping above the speedcap you will lose all of your speed completely. However, if you are looking backwards instead, you will literally gain speed. Assumning perfect conditions (angle and timing on the jump) your speed will double with every jump. It takes a skilled player only 7 jumps to go from the walking speed of 250 units per second, to the engine's internal limit of 3500 units per second. For comparsions sake, a real life Jet Plane has a speed of around 10000 units per second.
