<h1>About</h1>
<p>This website was made by Linus Nordin.<br><br>All videos were recorded by me, and all of the images were made by me in GIMP.<br><br>Credits to the SourceRuns team for the years of glitch-hunting and research done on the source engine. <br><br> Also, Shoutouts to Valve Software for making the games open-source so it's possible to read the code and see exactly what is happening (well, mostly anyways.) </p>
