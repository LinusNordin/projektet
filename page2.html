<h1>Portal</h1>
<p>This is the portal (the first game in the series) section. We're going to go through some of the glithes commonly found in portal speedrunning. </p>

<p>First of all, ABH is used everywhere in Portal. But, there is a section about that on the hl2 page, check that out if you wanna know that is about.</p>

<h2>Saveglitch</h2>
<p id="saveglitch">Saveglitch is a glitch that is used practically everywhere in portal speedrunning. It actually is more of a category name for a whole bunch of glitches, because so many different ways to do this gltich has been found. 

One of the ways to trigger saveglitch is to place down a portal below you, then approach the very edge of the portal from above. Once you are in position, you can execute the glitch by making a save and loading it afterwards. <br><br>
This will essentially split your "camera" from your actual position. It's a bit hard to explain, but what gets rendered on your screen is no longer where your actual position is. That's why, if you ever look at someone using saveglitch tactics, it will look as if they are shooting portals at nothing and walking through walls.<br>
In the video below, it is shown how saveglitch can be used how to skip a puzzle in the game completely.</p>

    <p>Notice the overlay on top left of the video. It shows where the <i>true</i> position of the player is, since the actual view of the game is misleading after doing the glitch.</p>
</div>
<h2>SLA</h2>
<p id="SLA">Save Load Abuse or SLA for short, is another glitch that is used everywhere in Portal. Theortically, Saveglitch that was discussed above, is a form of SLA. However there are loads of other forms of SLA. There's 2 main reasons for this, whenever you load a save all game scripting gets delayed for some microseconds (exact time can vary), and if the game thinks you are stuck, it will move you down about 2-4 inches. People usually have a bind that makes a save and then loads it one frame later, which they use to chain these loads together so they can save 20+ times in row to really break the game.<br><br>
    
One use of this is to do something called Button Save Glitch, where you can basically skip a puzzle in the game entirely by taking a radio or some other object and dragging it alongst the button and making 15-20 saves (with help of the bind discussed earlier) and then getting off the button before the game can catch up again.

<h2>LAG</h2>
<p id="LAG">Large Acute Angle Glitch or LAG for short, is a glitch within portal that happens when portals are placed on a surface that have an acute angle.<br> Despite it's name it has nothing to do with regular lagging. <br> Basically if you jump and un-crouch at the same time into a portal that is placed on an acute angle then you will be teleported to somewhere completely different else on the level. It isn't exactly known why this happens, but some have speculated that there is some mistakes done within vector math, one of the theories is that there is some critical vector that didn't get normalized properly.   </p>
